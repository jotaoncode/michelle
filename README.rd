MICHELLE
--------

Introduction:
-------------

This is my own shell, it started as a project at University, at a very begining with Debian 4.x, without any GUID. Right now I am making some changes to make it available for my Ubuntu. And also I am just adding some changes to make it more fun.

Objectives:
-----------
Make my own shell and improve it, and make it portable with git. So I can share with community and also I can find it any time I change my computer.

Description:
------------
Shell done in bash. It actually loads different modules in order to do your personal commands in bash.
